# OVERVIEW

Xcode provides several runtime code diagnostics tools during development.

To enable:

1. Go to scheme editor (click scheme pulldown and choose **Edit Scheme**, or with scheme selected: **Product** > **Scheme** > **Edit Scheme**, or **cmd+shift+,**).

2. Select **Run** or **Test** action and navigate to **Diagnostics** tab. Enable tools as needed.

Note: **Main Thread Checker** automatically enabled when running app with Xcode debugger.
