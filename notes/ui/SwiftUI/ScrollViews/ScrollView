# `ScrollView`

```swift
struct ScrollView<Content> where Content : View
```

Displays content within horizontally and vertically (no zoom) scrollable content region. As user performs scroll gestures, scroll view adjusts visible portion of content.

```swift
var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            ForEach(0..<100) {
                Text("Row \($0)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
