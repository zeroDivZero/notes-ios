# WHY TEST

Good tests give us confidence to make bold changes, help detect and resolve regressions early, and provide
comprehensive and practical description of expectations of app's functionality.

Overall, improves productivity.

Key word is "expectation". Tests cannot uncover bugs, only assure app functions as expected. Quality assurance, not quality insertion.
